2. Need pip installed, need all imports especially Tkinter.
run python3 main.py (on my mac machine)
3. This project creates a GUI that displays the entries from my wufoo form. It shows the complete data of all the entries that the user can select, and once selected it displays a window of all the entries from the form.
Additional features were added, and a user can now select a CUBES project to claim.
4. What works: GUI list shows, complete data should pop up once selected from a button, button should appear differently, and there is area for user to put in records.
What doesn't work: some of my tests doesn't pass. The users data may not go in table, when info is submitted with button - tkinter errors pop up.
