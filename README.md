2. Need pip installed, need all imports especially Tkinter.
run python3 Gui.py (on my mac machine)
3. This project creates a GUI that displays the entries from my database. It shows a short version of all the entries that the user can select, and once selected it displays a window of all the entries from the database.   
4. What works: GUI works, correct data should pop up once selected in a list.
What doesn't work: some of my tests doesn't pass
